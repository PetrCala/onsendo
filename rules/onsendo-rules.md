# Onsendo Challenge Ruleset

**Period:** October – December, 2025  
**Objective:** Complete all 88 onsens in Beppu while maintaining a sustainable, healthy daily routine that integrates physical exercise, recovery, and work-life balance.

## 1. Core Principles

1. Health and sustainability come first. The challenge should enhance physical and mental wellbeing, not compromise it.  
2. Each visit counts only if it is done with intention and presence — not rushed, not for the stamp alone.  
3. Consistency matters more than intensity: progress through steady, repeatable habits.  
4. The challenge aims to form a long-term routine that could, in principle, be maintained indefinitely.

## 2. Visit Frequency and Timing

1. **Target:** Two onsen visits per day on active days (one morning, one post-exercise).  
2. **Minimum valid visit:** 15 minutes total presence (shower + soak).  
3. **Recommended duration per visit:** 20–40 minutes (including shower, soak, cooldown).  
4. **Maximum total bathing time per day:** 90 minutes (excluding travel and dressing).  
5. **Weekly total cap:** 8 hours of onsen time (to limit fatigue and skin stress).  
6. **Morning visits** ideally before 9:00 a.m.; **recovery visits** before lunch when possible.  
7. Visits after 12:00 may replace morning ones only when schedule or closures require it.

## 3. Sauna Policy

1. Sauna sessions are **optional** but recommended up to **3–4 times per week** maximum.  
2. No more than **2 sauna sessions per day**, and **one** if combined with long running/hiking.  
3. Typical sauna stay: 8–12 minutes per round, followed by proper cooldown (5–10 min rest or cold rinse).  
4. If fatigue, dizziness, or dehydration occur — skip sauna entirely.  
5. Every 3–4 days, try to include **one sauna visit minimum** for circulation and recovery.
   - Exempt if no sauna is available during the 3-4 days period.

## 4. Exercise Integration

1. **Running:** 2–4 times per week (8–12 km average per session).  
2. **Gym or strength training:** 2–4 times per week (1.25–2 hours per session).  
3. **Saturday hike or long run:** Mandatory unless prevented by illness, injury, or unsafe weather conditions.
   - **Good weather:** Up and down Mt. Tsurumi (hiking).
   - **Poor weather:** Choose an alternative such as a long run session (≥ 15 km or ≥ 2.5 hours), Beppu city loop, or coastal route.
   - **Definition of poor weather:** Typhoon, heavy rain, strong wind, low visibility, dense fog, or nighttime running conditions.
   - **Duration:** Aim for approximately 3–6 hours for hikes, or ≥ 15 km / ≥ 2.5 hours for long runs.
   - **Recovery:** A post-exercise onsen session is required for muscle relaxation and recovery.
4. **Rest day:** At least one full or partial rest day weekly (no run/gym/hike).  
5. Avoid scheduling **more than two consecutive “high-load” days per week.**  
   - A “high-load” day is any day that includes:

      - a run longer than 10 km, **or**
      - a gym session lasting ≥ 1.5 h at moderate–high intensity, **or**
      - a sauna visit **combined with** either a long run or long hike.

   - After two such days in a row, insert an easier or recovery day (short run ≤ 6 km, mobility, or rest).
   The goal is to prevent cumulative heat stress and muscular fatigue while keeping the daily rhythm sustainable.

## 5. Health and Safety

1. Enter onsens only when well-hydrated.  
2. Eat lightly before morning soaks; rehydrate before and after saunas.  
3. Do not stay in hot water longer than 15 minutes continuously without cooling.  
4. Avoid entering if skin is irritated, healing from wounds, or if feverish.  
5. If cumulative fatigue persists >3 days, reduce both exercise and onsen load by 25–30% for one week.  
6. Prioritize sleep quality — minimum 7 hours per night, optimally 8.

---

## 6. Data and Logging

1. Record each visit in the tracking system.  
2. Missing data does **not invalidate** a visit but should be flagged for partial completeness.  
3. Weekly summary logs include:
   - Total onsens visited  
   - Total time spent soaking
   - Number of saunas used
   - Total km run and workout hours  
4. Data corrections allowed anytime; focus on accuracy and consistency over perfection.

---

## 7. Adaptation and Rule Review

1. Rules may be **reviewed once weekly on Sunday** (“Rule Review Sunday”).  
2. Adjustments allowed if:
   - Average fatigue or soreness > 3 consecutive days,  
   - Health symptoms arise, or  
   - Schedule changes (e.g., travel, work demand) make compliance unrealistic.  
3. Adjustments must be **documented** in the weekly log:
   - “Rule modified on YYYY-MM-DD: [reason + description].”  
4. No changes permitted more than once per week to maintain structural discipline.

---

## 8. Completion and Integrity

1. The challenge is **considered complete** when all 88 onsens have been visited at least once under these rules.  
2. Repeats are allowed but do not replace unvisited locations.  
3. Integrity principle: when uncertain if a visit “counts,” err on the stricter side — quality over quantity.  
4. Optional “Victory Lap Week” (Dec 14–19) may include favorite revisits, but not mandatory.

## 10. Guiding Thought
>
> *“Enter each bath as if for the first time — not to complete the count, but to complete the day.”*  
> The purpose of the 88 Onsen Challenge is not only to visit all baths, but to establish a rhythm of care, curiosity, and health that can outlast the challenge itself.
